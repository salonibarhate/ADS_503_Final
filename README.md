# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model to determine the presence of heart disease in patients based on various medical attributes. Utilizing the UCI Heart Disease dataset, we apply machine learning techniques to analyze patient data and predict heart disease outcomes.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease)
- **Instances**: 303  
- **Attributes**: 14 (including the target variable)  
- **Target Variable**: `num` (0 indicates no presence of heart disease; 1–4 indicate presence)

The dataset includes patient information such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, and thalassemia.

## Objective

To build and evaluate machine learning models that can accurately predict the presence of heart disease in patients, facilitating early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding data distributions and relationships between variables.  
3. **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most significant features contributing to heart disease prediction.  
4. **Model Development**: Implementing classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines.  
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.  
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model parameters to improve performance.  
7. **Final Model Selection**: Choosing the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
